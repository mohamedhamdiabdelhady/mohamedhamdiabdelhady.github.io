				<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

				<p>The objective of the current study is to ensure achieving the future National renewable energy target with a minimum investment and energy costs through the identification of suitable geographical sites, guided by the CREMP, and achieve the highest possible capacity factor and capacity credit of these plants through optimized simulation approach. This includes (i) Updating the identified geographical and technological proposal made by the CREMP for the requested added plants, according to the approved scenario by the Integrated Energy Strategy for Egypt 2035; (ii) Conducting simulations considering an optimized output for the plants’ output annual curves and capacity credit; (iii) Conducting pre-investment analysis including prefeasibility to find out the Levelized Cost of Energy per unit output, for each simulated plant.</p>
				
				
				
				<p>In the present study, the state of the art for different renewable energy technologies including onshore wind energy, solar PV, CSP and storage was briefly reviewed with an outlook for future research and industrial innovations targeting increasing efficiency, capacity factor and cost reductions.</p>
				
				<p>A review was carried out for the outcome of the CREMP and TARES studies including evaluation of their assumptions and considerations of new updated and developments in the national target and energy strategy and technology costs.</p>
				<p>Computer simulations and optimization were carried out using WindPro and WASP modeling Software for proposed grid connected Wind projects considering all areas of high and moderate potential. The SAM Advisor Model is used for technical and economic simulation and sizing of proposed grid connected PV and CSP plants. Hybrid Wind-PV and CSP-PV plants were simulated using both programs in addition to MATLAB and excel with the purpose of increasing capacity factor and reduction of investments and levelized cost of electrical energy. Investments and levelized cost of electrical energy (LCOE) were also estimated and optimized for all technologies. Areas of highest potential are selected first and followed by areas of lower potential with possible accessibility to the national grid.</p>
				
				<h3>Highlights of Results</h3>
				
			
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Total area allocated::</strong> The areas allocated for Renewable Energy Projects by the presidential decree 116 (2016) and the renewable energy potential map developed in the CREMP study for different technologies were the basis of the first iteration for placing different renewable energy projects by 2040. Additional needed areas are selected according to the highest potential of wind and solar energies available as listed in the CREMP study. If the renewable energy strategy is finalized and approved, a new presidential decree could be issued for new areas. The areas needed to satisfy the energy demand forecast by 2040 for Wind Solar PV and CSP are 8476.4, 1250 and 348.5 km2 respectively.</li>
					<li><strong>Total installed capacity:</strong> Capacities selected for different technologies in the CREMP study were based on lower average capacity factors and the electricity grid was assumed to be uniformly loaded. No uncertainty levels were specified in this study and the wind turbine hub heights were limited to 60 m. New areas with high and moderate wind potential were included in the present study. Additionally, new technology innovations were taken into consideration in the current study, such as higher Wind Turbine hub heights, higher efficiency, PV module tracking and technology hybridization. The proposed installed capacities for wind, PV and CSP are 20.2, 60.5 and 4.1 GW respectively. These capacities were estimated in coordination with the work in component C2. The estimated annual electrical energy production for the wind, solar PV and CSP projects are 90.36, 180.55 and 24.68 TWh respectively with a total of 295.59 TWh. The avoided annual CO2 emissions are in the order of 148 Mton. Hybrid Wind/PV and CSP/PV plants were simulated in Menia and Elkharga in order to demonstrate the possible improvements in the capacity factor in these areas.</li>
					<li><strong>Total Investment:</strong> Future investments are estimated for the proposed projects in the selected areas based on three different scenarios including current technology cost, moderate and optimistic forecast of the technology learning curves. Considering the current technology costs, the installation costs were found to be 22.7, 55 and 23.33 b$ for wind, PV and CSP projects respectively with the current technology cost. Considering the low and optimistic cost scenario, these installation costs are expected to drop to 14.64, 17.36 and 14.54 b$ respectively.</li>
					<li><strong>Cost benefit of increasing Wind Turbine rotor diameter and hub height:</strong> Currently, the allowed max high for blade tip is 150 m in east and west of the Nile and 100 m in the Suez gulf. With the increase of hub height to 120 m, (allowing bigger rotor diameters), the generated energy is increased from 90364802.53 to 100517547.1 MWh with an increase of 10152744.5 MWh (11.23%), while the increase in cost is 1414 M$ in the simulations. The predicted simple payback period for the additional investment needed to increase the hub height from 90 to 120 m is around 3.87 years based on the current assumptions.</li>
					<li><strong>Cost benefit of PV module tracking:</strong> Applying single axis tracking for PV modules will acquire an efficiency of up to 34% with a payback period of less than one year for the incremental cost of the tracking system. With the expected continuous increase of PV module efficiency according to the learning curve extrapolation (lead by innovations and research), it is expected that module costs will drop further.</li>
					<li><strong>Hybridization of CSP/PV:</strong> Simulations are carried out on different configurations of CSP/PV hybrid plants in order to find the optimum solar multiple and hours of storage that yield the highest capacity factor and LCOE. Optimization of hybrid CSP/PV showed that the highest capacity factor is obtained at a solar multiple of 2.2 rendering a LCOE of 7.47 Cent$/kWh.</li>
					<li><strong>Effect of Wind/PV hybridization:</strong> PV arrays installed between wind parks will not significantly affect the wind regime and could improve the overall capacity factor if the wind and solar peaks are not occurring at the same time. However, it was found that this improvement is limited to small PV capacities of less than 1 GW as compared to 8.1 GW for wind in west Menia.</li>
